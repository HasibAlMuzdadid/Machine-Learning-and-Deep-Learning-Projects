## Project Description :
This repository contains various **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** projects which I have implemented so far for self-learning and the completion of various online courses offered on different platforms like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [freeCodeCamp] & others and also this reflects what I have learnt by taking these courses.
